# Reflection
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.

# Design

<h3>What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?</h3>
The most helpful thing about thinking about design methods of our project was using online resources and techniques that we learned in some courses about user experience to determine some designs that would work best for our project. We wanted to make sure that our bot was not too complex and easy to use. The main use for our bot was to easily obtain information from Reddit for users on Discord, so user experience was a big deal to us when considering the design methods for our bot.

<h3>What was most difficult? What would you do differently?</h3>
The most difficult part about implementing certain designs and/or deciding which ones to utilize was my lack of experience in developing bots. This was the first bot that I have developed so most things that we used were new to me. If there was something I would do differently, it would be to involve more user testing outside of our group. This would help us determine what specific designs are feasible and practical to include in our final design. Sometimes, different users can point out issues that the developers may not have noticed.

<h3>What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?</h3>
Some design methods that I would want to try again in the future on another project include storyboarding and user scenarios. To me, these methods seem very useful in determining and laying out exactly what functionality and design patterns that we need to include in the final product. We have to ensure that our finals product meets the needs described in user scenarios and storyboards.
 
 
# Implementation

<h3>What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?</h3>
The most helpful thing about implementing, testing, and integration in our bot project was, like mentioned previously, utilizing online resources. Specifically, for our bot, there were specific commands and attribute tags that we could use to gather information from Reddit. We were successfully able to incorporate these things into our code and easily display these items when testing within Discord.  

<h3>What was most difficult? What would you do differently?</h3>
The most difficult part about implementation was probably trying to work on certain aspects of the project at the same time. Sometimes, it was difficult to work on certain parts of some commands at the same time as someone else because this could result in issues when merging. Therefore, it would have been better to work on these tasks at separate times after pulling the first changes that are made.

<h3>What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?</h3>
Some methods that I might want to try again in the future on another project is continuous integration, which involves committing changes frequently to ensure that all group members have an up to date version of the project. Furthermore, I would continue to use unit testing to ensure that our code is carrying out the intended functionality.

# Process

<h3>What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?</h3>
The most helpful thing about implementing kanban and code review in our project was that it helped us organize our work and delegate tasks. This allowed us to split up our work and overall be more productive. Then, when we were ready to merge all of our changes, code review allowed us to fix and recommend changes to other group memberâ€™s code. This helped us make a final product to the best of our ability.

<h3>What was most difficult? What would you do differently?</h3>
The most difficult part about the process was probably transforming the software requirements into the design. We knew most of what we wanted to include for our bot, but there were some things that were difficult to incorporate. If I were to do something differently, I would probably try doing more research instead of trying to guess the code and make it work. If I did more research from the start, I probably could have finished the process a little quicker.

<h3>What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?</h3>
The most significant practice I want to try again in the future on another project is using the GitHub project board when working together as a group. As stated previously, the project board will help organize and delegate tasks. This will save us time and prevent others from working on the same tasks which could cause conflicts in the code.

# Overall
<h3>Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.</h3>
Overall, considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes that I have encountered, it is clear that when taking into account all the benefits of the different practices that they can be useful together. To start off, laying out all the processes that can be utilized will serve as a guide for design methods and implementation practices. For example, organizing the process through something like kanban and incorporating code review will ensure that the project is organized and complete. Certain useful design methods can be delegated as tasks and be used throughout the development of the project as a guide to implement everything that is required.
